# Full-Names
Full Names Write a function that takes in a first name and a last name, and prints out a nicely formatted full name, in a sentence. Your sentence could be as simple as, "Hello, full_name." Call your function three separate times, utilizing different names each time. 


def full_name(first_name, last_name):
    print(f"Hello, {first_name} {last_name}.")

# Calling the function three times with different names
full_name("Kevin", "James")
full_name("Jane", "Smith")
full_name("Emily", "Johnson")
